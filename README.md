# shu-chen.com
shu-chen.com is my personal website, started from the ground up. 

## Objective
This project serves as a vibrant showcase of my web development journey, encompassing front-end and back-end skills, as well as my understanding of web hosting and git. It is a platform where I can express my person and professional identity, share my current endeavors, and outline my aspirations for the future. Join me as I navigate through the evolving landscapes of technology and personal development, planting a flag for both my audience and myself.
